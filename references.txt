Notes :
-------

# The <ng-template> is an Angular element for rendering HTML. It is never displayed directly. In fact, before rendering the view, Angular replaces the <ng-template> and its contents with a comment.
  If there is no structural directive and you merely wrap some elements in a <ng-template>, those elements disappear.

# The Angular <ng-container> is a grouping element that doesn't interfere with styles or layout because
  Angular doesn't put it in the DOM.
